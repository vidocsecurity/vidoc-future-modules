# vidoc-future-modules
This repostiory contains how future Vidoc modules might work and look like. This is only for https://thehacksummit.com/

Vidoc want to give ethical hackers, red teamers and security engineers a simpler way of creating custom scripts. We want to replace Nuclei and other tools with a more modular approach.

## Features

- YAML modules - define custom security checks in YAML (like Nuclei)
- Javascript modules - define custom security checks in Javascript (with the speed of Golang)
- Easy to use - Vidoc is easy to use and has a simple CLI
- Seamless scaling - detect vulnerabilities in 1000,000 hosts
- Speed - Vidoc is written in Golang
