## TL;DR;

**One-click Recon, Vulnerability Scanning automation, custom security checks, for security teams and pros. No setup needed.**

Vidoc is a platform that handles the infrastructure for you. Scanning is powered by Modules. We improved on the known concept of Templates and **[we wrote our own module engine](/features/module-scan)**.

## Core Vidoc features

- **Zero setup.** Just write your modules and run them. All results in one place.
- **Speed.** You can run Modules against thousands of hosts in matter of minutes.
- **YAML modules compatible with Nuclei\*.** You can use all Nuclei modules with Vidoc.
- **[Passive Modules](/features/passive-modules).** Think of it as grep on ALL responses that were received from the target (even if they were received by other modules).
- **Automated scans. (BETA)** Schedule your scans to run periodically.
- **[Javascript modules](/features/javascript-modules). (BETA)** Real Javascript, not string embedded in YAML.
- **AI Report generation.** Generate pentest report based on the results of your scan.
- **AI target insights.** Get insights about your target.
- **IP rotation.** Each Module Scan is executed by a pool of workers that rotate IPs.

\* You can use our importer to convert Nuclei modules to Vidoc modules.

This is what security automation looks like in the 21st century.
