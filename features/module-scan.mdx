## What is Module Scan?

It is a scanning feature that allows you to execute [Modules](/features/modules) on a target or list of targets. You can use modules from Module Library or create your own modules.

**Features of Module Scan**
- Each Module Scan is executed by a pool of workers that rotate IPs
- Module Scan is designed to be fast and efficient
- You can execute Module on thousands of targets in a few minutes

Want to schedule a scan? Check out [Scheduled Scans](/features/scheduled-scans).

## What is the use case of Module Scan?

You can use Modules to detect misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and other security issues on your targets. The powerful thing about Modules is that you can write your own Modules and execute them on your targets.

## How to use Module Scan?

1. Go click "Scanning" -> "Module library" -> "Scan now"
2. Select modules you want to execute on your targets
3. Click "Execute"
4. Select target or targets from Recon
5. Click "Execute"
6. Wait for results:)

## How to identify Vidoc requests?

We will add a custom header to all requests sent by Vidoc.

The headers will be:
```
X-Vidoc-Scan-Id: <uuid>
X-Vidoc-Security: <project_id>; https://docs.vidocsecurity.com/scanning
```

You can allowlist these headers in your WAF or other security tools:
- you can check if `X-Vidoc-Security` header is present and contains your project id.

To setup allowlist, send us a quick email to [Support](mailto:contact@vidocsecurity.com) and we will help you with that.
