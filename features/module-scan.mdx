## What is Module Scan?

TL;DR;
- Each Module Scan is executed by a pool of workers that rotate IPs
- Module Scan is designed to be fast and efficient
- You can execute Module on thousands of targets in a few minutes

It is a scanning feature that allows you to execute [Modules](/features/modules) on a target or list of targets. You can use modules from Module Library or create your own modules.

Want to schedule a scan? Check out [Scheduled Scans](/features/scheduled-scans).

## What is the usecase of Module Scan?

You can use Modules to detect misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and other security issues on your targets. The powerful thing about Modules is that you can write your own Modules and execute them on your targets.
