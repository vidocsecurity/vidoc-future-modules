## What is Passive Module?

It is like `grep` for ANY response. Passive Module does not send any request to the target, it just looks for the pattern in the response of the request that is already sent by other modules.

Example of Passive Module:

```yaml passive_module.yaml
info:
  name: Detect Nginx
  severity: informative
  tags:
    - tech

global-matchers:
  matchers:
    - type: word
      part: all
      words:
        - Nginx
      condition: and
  matchers-condition: and
```

## When to use Passive Module?

Passive Modules are best for:
- Detecting the technology used by the target
- Detecting the version of the technology used by the target
- Secret detection
